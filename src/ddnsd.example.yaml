# The two most common services for dynamic DNS updates for homelab users
# are Cloudflare and DuckDNS. Although Cloudflare is more flexible and
# powerful, DuckDNS is simpler to set up and use for basic needs.
provider: duckdns

# Inorder for ddns to work, you must have a domain name registered with
# the service you choose. For DuckDNS, this is a subdomain of duckdns.org
# making your full domain name <subdomain>.duckdns.org.
#
# For Cloudflare, you must have a domain name registered with any domain
# registrar and then use Cloudflare's nameservers for that domain.
domain: your-subdomain

# This is the API token for your Cloudflare or DuckDNS account. For Cloudflare, you can
# create a token with the necessary permissions in your Cloudflare dashboard. For DuckDNS,
# you can find your token on the DuckDNS website after logging in.
#
# Example: 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef

  # Enable/disable proxying through Cloudflare. NOTE: if you are using this with a local
  # vpn service like Tailscale, OpenVPN or WireGuard you must set this to false.
  # true - Proxy enabled (orange cloud)

  proxy: false
  # The TTL (time to live) for the DNS record in seconds. This is how long

DuckDNS:
  # This setting allows you to enable insecure connections to the DuckDNS API using HTTP instead
  # of HTTPS. This generally not recommended due to security concerns, but it can be useful in
  # certain situations.
  #
  # Default: false.
  insecure: false
  # Should the output from DuckDNS be more verbose? This setting controls whether
  # This helps you see more detailed information about the updates being made.
  #
  # Default: false.
